# TAROTJS

## About

This project stems from a few different aspirations and interestests... I've been interested in coding the mechanics of a deck of cards using javascript for a while now. In an effort to find some code or tutorials that already accomplished the thing that I wanted to do, I came across Walter Guevara's website, "*That Software Dude*, he has [an article](https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/6196/coding-a-card-deck-in-javascript) talking about exactly what I was looking for; how to code a deck of cards in javascript.

Since I didn't just want to just replicate and type the code that Guevara put together verbatim, I thought it would be interesting to use Tarot instead, since it does share similarities with regular playing cards. [The Internet Sacred Text Archive](https://www.sacred-texts.com/tarot/pkt/tarot0.htm) has a similar javascript spread, but it is fairly limited and was written almost a quarter of a century ago.

I have also seen projects using [E Kelen](https://github.com/ekelen)'s "[tarot-api](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api)," but it might be useful to expand on that work, or make something entirely self-contained.

The current version of the script includes a class that also plays out a psuedo game of War using the Tarot deck. This was implemented based on the week 6 Promineo Tech front-end coding bootcamp, which is a course that I am taking as of the writing of this README. When the assignment was proposed I thought it would be a good way to learn how to manipulate a deck of cards, specifically this digital Tarot deck.

We are currently in Week 8 and this project has been updated to achieve the goals set forth for the current assignment which involves HTML and CSS. Prior versions of the code only output to the console.

## TODO

- ~~Implement some type of system for generating different spreads.~~
- Incorporate text from the *The Pictorial Key to the Tarot* by A.E. Waite and/or from other public domain sources.
- ~~Display scans of the Tarot cards for various different spreads.~~
    Scans courtesty of [luciellaes on itch.io](https://luciellaes.itch.io/rider-waite-smith-tarot-cards-cc0).
- Add some animations to the cards as they are laid down for the spread.
- Incorporate interactive elements for reading the cards, either hovers or click events that pull up additional information.
- Complete the interpretation section: have each card's description laid out with the postion explanation.
